![Configuration Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Configuration_Testing-FF5722?style=for-the-badge)

### Definition
Configuration testing is a type of testing that evaluates how software performs in different configurations of hardware, operating systems, network settings, or application parameters. This ensures that the application behaves correctly across various environments and setups, validating its reliability and stability.

### Example
Consider a web application designed to run on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Configuration testing involves testing the application in each combination of these environments to ensure that it behaves consistently. 

For instance:
- Testing the application on **Windows 10** with **Chrome 90**.
- Testing the same application on **macOS Big Sur** with **Firefox 89**.
- Testing the application‚Äôs functionality with **Linux Ubuntu** and **Safari**.

In each case, the tester verifies that all features work as intended and that there are no performance issues or errors, regardless of the configuration used.

## üîÑ Recovery Testing

![Recovery Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Recovery_Testing-2196F3?style=for-the-badge)

### Definition
Recovery testing is a type of testing that evaluates how well a system can recover from crashes, hardware failures, or unexpected errors. This process assesses the system‚Äôs ability to restore data and return to its operational state after a failure, ensuring that users do not lose critical information or functionality.

### Example
Imagine a banking application that processes transactions. Recovery testing involves simulating a sudden crash or failure during a transaction. For example:

1. A user is transferring funds when the application crashes unexpectedly due to a power failure.
2. Recovery testing checks whether the system can:
   - Detect the crash and log the error.
   - Restore the transaction state upon restart.
   - Ensure that no funds were lost or duplicated during the process.

By testing these scenarios, the team ensures that the application can handle unexpected issues gracefully and maintain data integrity.

## üì¶ Installation Testing

![Installation Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Installation_Testing-FF9800?style=for-the-badge)

### Definition
Installation testing is a type of software testing that verifies the installation process of an application. This testing ensures that the software installs, configures, and uninstalls correctly across various environments and setups. It focuses on the usability of the installation process and ensures that all components are installed correctly and are functional after installation.

### Example
Consider a new software application that needs to be installed on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Installation testing involves:

1. **Installation Process**:
   - Testing the installation on **Windows 10** by running the installer and ensuring it completes without errors.
   - Verifying that all required components (e.g., libraries, dependencies) are installed.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Ensuring that configuration files are created correctly.
   - Checking if the application can connect to a database or other services as expected.

3. **Uninstallation**:
   - Testing the uninstallation process to ensure that all components are removed completely and no leftover files or registry entries remain.

By performing these tests, the team ensures a smooth installation experience for users, minimizing potential issues during deployment.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Compliance Testing

![Compliance Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Compliance_Testing-009688?style=for-the-badge)

### Definition
Compliance testing is a type of testing that ensures software meets specified standards, regulations, and guidelines. This testing verifies that the application complies with industry standards, legal requirements, and organizational policies.

### Example
For instance, a financial application must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Compliance testing would involve:
- Ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and storage.
- Verifying access controls to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information.

By conducting compliance testing, organizations ensure they meet legal obligations and reduce the risk of legal penalties.

## üèóÔ∏è **3. System Testing**
 ![System Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/System_Testing-26A69A?style=for-the-badge)

**System Testing** is a high-level testing phase that verifies the complete and integrated software product. It evaluates the application's compliance with specified requirements and checks both functional and non-functional aspects. The goal is to validate the end-to-end system specifications and ensure that the software meets the desired quality standards before it goes into production.

### üìù Example Scenario:
Consider a **shopping website** where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and make purchases. During system testing, testers would evaluate the entire application to ensure that users can navigate the site, that the shopping cart functions properly, and that payments are processed correctly.

### **Types of Testing in System Testing**

System testing encompasses several types of testing to ensure comprehensive coverage:

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **1. Functional Testing**
**Definition**: This testing verifies that the software functions according to the specified requirements.

- **Example**: Testing the login functionality of a web application to ensure that valid credentials allow access while invalid credentials are denied.

- **Tools**:

#### üß© **2. Non-Functional Testing**
Non-functional testing assesses aspects of the application that are not related to specific behaviors or functions. It can include:

- üé® **User Interface Testing**: Evaluates the usability and aesthetic aspects of the application.

  - **Example**: Checking if the buttons and links on a webpage are properly aligned and functional.

- üéØ **Error Guessing Testing**: Based on experience, testers identify potential error-prone areas and test those.

  - **Example**: Testing the application with boundary values, such as entering an age of -1 or 150 in a form that accepts ages between 0 and 120.

  - **Tools**:

- üóÇÔ∏è **Input Domain Testing**: Focuses on validating the application against various input conditions and domains.

  - **Example**: Testing a form to ensure it only accepts valid email addresses.

  - **Tools**:

- üìä **Database Testing**: Ensures that the database performs as expected, verifying data integrity and correctness.

  - **Example**: Checking that a user's profile data is correctly saved and retrieved from the database.

  - **Tools**:

- üî¢ **Calculation Testing**: Verifies the accuracy of calculations within the application.

  - **Example**: Testing a financial application to ensure that interest calculations are performed correctly based on various inputs.

  - **Tools**: Excel, QuickTest Professional

- üîó **Links & URLs Testing**: Validates that all hyperlinks and URLs within the application are functional and lead to the correct destinations.

  - **Example**: Checking all navigation links on a website to ensure they direct users to the appropriate pages.

### **Real-Life Example of System Testing**

For a **mobile banking application**, system testing could involve:

1. **Functional Testing**: Verifying that users can log in, check their balance, and transfer funds.
2. **User Interface Testing**: Ensuring the app's layout is consistent across different devices and screen sizes.
3. **Database Testing**: Checking that transactions are correctly recorded in the back-end database after a user performs a fund transfer.
4. **Input Domain Testing**: Testing for valid and invalid account numbers when transferring funds.
5. **Links & URLs Testing**: Verifying that help and support links lead users to the correct documentation or contact forms.

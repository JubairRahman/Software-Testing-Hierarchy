### üßë‚Äçüíª Usability Testing

![Usability Testing Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Usability_Testing-4CAF50?style=for-the-badge)

- **Definition**: Usability testing assesses how easy and user-friendly an application is for end-users.
- **Example**: Observing users as they interact with a new mobile app to identify areas where they struggle, such as complex navigation or unclear instructions. Feedback is used to enhance the user experience.

### üíæ Memory Leakage Testing

- **Definition**: This testing identifies memory leaks in an application, which occur when memory is not released after it is no longer needed, leading to reduced performance over time.
- **Example**: Running a desktop application for an extended period while monitoring its memory usage. If the memory continues to grow without being released, it indicates a memory leak that needs to be fixed.

### üíΩ Volume Testing

- **Definition**: Volume testing evaluates how the application handles large amounts of data in databases and storage systems.
- **Example**: Testing a data entry application by inputting thousands of records to see how it performs under high data load, ensuring that it maintains performance without crashing or slowing down.

### üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility Testing

- **Definition**: Compatibility testing ensures that the application works as intended across different environments, browsers, devices, and operating systems.
- **Example**: Testing a web application on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops) to verify that it renders correctly and performs consistently across all platforms.

### Summary
Each focus area in performance testing is crucial for ensuring that applications not only function correctly but also deliver a satisfying user experience. Conducting thorough performance testing helps identify and resolve potential issues before they affect end-users.
